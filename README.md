collapsible_filter_tips-7.x
===========================

A simple Drupal module that makes text filter tips display in a collapsible block for better form UI.

This module provides very similar functionality as the Simplified Formats module by @codycraven (https://www.drupal.org/project/simplified_formats), so I opted to not push it upstream.
